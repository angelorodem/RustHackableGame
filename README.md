# Rust Hackable Game

Simple project to test Rust basic features including some libraries like FlatBuffers and Tokio,

it is intentionally vulnerable to serve as a simple CTF, do not take the server behavior of assuming the client packets as legitimate as a good example.

It uses FlatBuffers to serialize the game data packets and uses tokio for networking.
